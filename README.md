Project for Johns Hopkins Coursera course Developing Data Products, course 9 of the Data Science Specialization

Shiny App: Wordcloud for Jane Austen's works

The app generates a word cloud of one of Jane Austen books. The user may select in the side panel the book (from "Emma", "Mansfield Park", "Northanger Abbey", "Persuasion", "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility"), the minimum frequency of the words in the cloud (from 1 to 50) and the maximum number of words to appear in the cloud (from 1 to 300).

The books were downloaded from http://www.gutenberg.org

The wordcloud app was based on the Shiny model in https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/082-word-cloud

Run the app in https://sanmame.shinyapps.io/austen_wordcloud/
